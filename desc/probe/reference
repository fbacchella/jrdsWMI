PERF_COUNTER_LARGE_RAWCOUNT_HEX
Decimal 256

PERF_RAW_FRACTION
Decimal 537003008
Ratio of a subset to its set as a percentage. This counter type displays the current percentage only, not an average over time.

PERF_SAMPLE_FRACTION
Decimal 549585920
Average ratio of hits to all operations during the last two sample intervals. This counter type requires a base property with the PERF_SAMPLE_BASE counter type.

Decimal 4195328
This counter type shows the change in the measured attribute between the two most recent sample intervals.

PERF_COUNTER_LARGE_DELTA
Decimal 4195584
Same as PERF_COUNTER_DELTA but a 64-bit representation for larger values.

PERF_ELAPSED_TIME
Decimal 807666944
Total time between when the process started and the time when this value is calculated.

PERF_AVERAGE_BULK
Decimal 1073874176
Number of items processed, on average, during an operation. This counter type displays a ratio of the items processed (such as bytes sent) to the number of operations completed, and requires a base property with PERF_AVERAGE_BASE as the counter type.

PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER
Decimal 272696320
Average number of operations completed during each second of the sample interval.

PERF_SAMPLE_COUNTER
Decimal 4260864
Average number of operations completed in one second. This counter type requires a base property with the counter type PERF_SAMPLE_BASE.

PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT
Decimal 272696576
Average number of operations completed during each second of the sample interval. This counter type is the same as the PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER type, but it uses larger fields to accommodate larger values.

PERF_COUNTER_TIMER
Decimal 541132032
Average time that a component is active as a percentage of the total sample time.

PERF_COUNTER_TIMER_INV
Decimal 557909248
Average percentage of time observed during sample interval that the object is not active. This counter type is the same as PERF_100NSEC_TIMER_INV except that it measures time in units of ticks of the system performance timer rather than in 100ns units.

PERF_AVERAGE_TIMER
Decimal 805438464
Average time to complete a process or operation. This counter type displays a ratio of the total elapsed time of the sample interval to the number of processes or operations completed during that time.
This counter type requires a base property with PERF_AVERAGE_BASE as the counter type.

PERF_100NSEC_TIMER
Decimal 542180608
Active time of one component as a percentage of the total elapsed time in units of 100ns of the sample interval.

PERF_100NSEC_TIMER_INV
Decimal 558957824
Percentage of time the object was not in use. This counter type is the same as PERF_COUNTER_TIMER_INV except that it measures time in 100ns units rather than in system performance timer ticks.

PERF_COUNTER_MULTI_TIMER
Decimal 574686464
Active time of one or more components as a percentage of the total time of the sample interval. This counter type differs from PERF_100NSEC_MULTI_TIMER in that it measures time in units of ticks of the system performance timer, rather than in 100ns units.
This counter type requires a base property with the PERF_COUNTER_MULTI_BASE counter type.

PERF_COUNTER_MULTI_TIMER_INV
Decimal 591463680
Inactive time of one or more components as a percentage of the total time of the sample interval. This counter type differs from PERF_100NSEC_MULTI_TIMER_INV in that it measures time in units of ticks of the system performance timer, rather than in 100ns units.
This counter type requires a base property with the PERF_COUNTER_MULTI_BASE counter type.

PERF_100NSEC_MULTI_TIMER
Decimal 575735040
This counter type shows the active time of one or more components as a percentage of the total time (100ns units) of the sample interval.
This counter type requires a base property with the PERF_COUNTER_MULTI_BASE counter type.

PERF_100NSEC_MULTI_TIMER_INV
Decimal 592512256
Inactive time of one or more components as a percentage of the total time of the sample interval. Counters of this type measure time in 100ns units.
This counter type requires a base property with the PERF_COUNTER_MULTI_BASE counter type.

PERF_OBJ_TIME_TIMER
Decimal 543229184
A 64-bit timer in object-specific units.

PERF_PRECISION_SYSTEM_TIMER
Decimal 541525248
Similar to PERF_COUNTER_TIMER except that it uses a counter defined time base instead of the system timestamp.

PERF_PRECISION_100NS_TIMER
Decimal 542573824
Similar to PERF_100NSEC_TIMER except that it uses a 100ns counter defined time base instead of the system 100ns timestamp.

PERF_COUNTER_QUEUELEN_TYPE
Decimal 4523008
Average length of a queue to a resource over time. It shows the difference between the queue lengths observed during the last two sample intervals divided by the duration of the interval.

PERF_COUNTER_LARGE_QUEUELEN_TYPE
Decimal 4523264
Average length of a queue to a resource over time. Counters of this type display the difference between the queue lengths observed during the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the interval.

PERF_COUNTER_100NS_QUEUELEN_TYPE
Decimal 5571840
Average length of a queue to a resource over time in 100 nanosecond units.
